    <p>Throughout my college years, I immersed myself in numerous roles and experiences. I was an entrepreneurship fellow, a teacher, a tutor, a finance intern, a VC fellow, an aspiring founder, a software engineering intern, a crypto enthusiast, a botanist, and ultimately, a government researcher. Each of these roles imparted valuable skills and unique experiences that became integral to my early twenties. Despite these enriching opportunities, I often felt overwhelmed, tired, and stressed, likely due to the self-imposed pressure to excel in every endeavor.

Even in my personal life, I was constantly rushing, rarely experiencing moments of tranquility. There were only two exceptions: the fall semester of 2023, when health issues necessitated a withdrawal from in-person classes, leading me to pursue online education, and the spring semester, which became a period of existential reflection.

A pivotal moment occurred during a session with my math tutor, who highlighted the gaps in my knowledge stemming from my diverse interests and lack of specialization. She advised me to focus on one thing and excel at it. This advice left me contemplating my varied pursuits and questioning my true passion. Science has always been my first love, but I was uncertain about how to channel this passion into a career.

As I approach my final class and internship, I am determined to answer this question for myself. My goal is to embrace stillness, slow down, and rediscover the joy in my pursuits.

To support this journey, I plan to use this website as a tool to build skills and monitor my progress. This platform will serve as a comprehensive repository for my learning experiences, providing a structured way to track my development in various areas. By documenting my achievements and challenges, I aim to gain deeper insights into my strengths and areas for improvement.

Moreover, the website will enable me to set specific, measurable goals and timelines for my skill acquisition, ensuring that I remain focused and motivated. Through regular updates and reflections, I can maintain a clear perspective on my growth and adjust my strategies as needed.

Ultimately, this website will not only help me develop and refine my skills but also serve as a testament to my commitment to personal and professional growth. By embracing a more mindful approach to my pursuits, I hope to find balance and fulfillment in my journey.
